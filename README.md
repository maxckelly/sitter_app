## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

- The problem I am trying to solve is the hassle and time consuming task of finding a babysitter to look after their children. I want to build a low cost app which targets parents who live an active life and require a regular or infrequent babysitter. The babysitters will be only women and uni students who have already had the experience and looking for part-time jobs while they study.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
- It is a problem that needs solving as a large amount of parents find it hard to find a reliable and experienced babysitter for an affordable price. On-top of that parents sometimes face cancellation, babysitters calling in sick and more. Thus effecting their plans. We solve this issue by providing a platform where they can quickly and easily book the 'sitters' in an uber like way.
